Hi,

I just came across full stack opportunities at company. 

Past summer, my team's IoT Hack won the 1st place at Sabre's annual Hackathon in Las Vegas. Some of my hackathon and side projects can be found on my Github.

Currently, I am an Intern and Engineer #10 at Rechat, where I work on its core API and internal tools.

I am really excited about the things that company is working on and would love to be a part of your team for a semester. Please see my Resume (attached).

Thanks,
Rahul Sonwalkar
